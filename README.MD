# Summoner

## What Am I?


Summoner is a work-in-progress game with the dorky theme of summoning demons and fighting with them.  It is essentially an early generation pokemon game with some systems added and others removed, with a dark fantasy skin.  

It presently uses Node.js and inquirer to get a users input. An earlier version of the progam (Legacy/Summoner.mjs) had most of the features that I wanted, such as working battles, xp and leveling, a time / day / sleep system, random encounters and a library / move learning system.

However, as I started this before enrolling in my bootcamp, I made a lot of mistakes with the design which were becoming more and more apparent as more features were added.  I also learned about stacks and realised that most of these problems could be solved if I built the program again from the ground up using an OOP philosophy.  I also wanted to entirely redesign the interface to be more aesthetic and defined, rather than just a mash of menus with totally inconsistent sizes and designs. 

## Current Progress


I am currently going about implementing all the functionality that I had previously with this new approach.  The battle system is also being redesigned from the ground up to be more balanced (I'm copying pokemon's attack damage formulas rather than imrpovising my own that I won't have time to properly balance, which was my previous approach) and also implementing improved features such as much more advanced status effects.

Once this functionality is implemented, I will then be able to use the new improved functions to write a story for the game, which would have taken a very long time previously.  

### Target base game features:

- Battle demons
- Summon Demons
- Time of Day / Sleep
- Teach demons moves
- Explore the environment
- Aesthetic, vibey menu design.
- Interesting story with events and boss battles.
